　　Motivation(动机) to satisfy one‘s needs is brought about by ―drives‖, These ―drives‖ do not determine man‘s behaviour, but rather direct man‘s energy towards certain aims. For example, man‘s body requires food, which is a biological need, when this need comes up, man feels uncomfortable and his thoughts turn to getting food or satisfying that need. If he is very hungry, it will difficult for him to pay enough attention to anything except his need for food.
　　While all men feel hungry, there is more than one method for helping free people of this uncomfortable feeling. How needs are satisfying depends on what we have been taught or what we have learned from our experiences. As we grow, we learn shat foods our society considers acceptable, and how they should be prepared and eaten. In some societies, for example, pork is considered a special food while in other societies it is strictly forbidden. In some societies fish is always cooked, but in other societies raw (生的) fish is preferred. The way in which we satisfy a drive is a learned response. Nature has not built a food – getting response into man. He cannot just eat whatever he wants of whenever there is food, his satisfaction of the hunger drive, for example, is limited by the rules of a society. Although we are hunger, according to the rules of society, we should not steal food, even if it belongs someone weaker than we are.
