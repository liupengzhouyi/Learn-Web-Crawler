41.答案为A。此句为推理题。将1n Ghana dinner is usually from four in the afternoon to six in the evening.But there are no strict rules about time.Whenever a guest arrives，a family offers food.这两句内容综合一下。就是：只要在下午4点至晚上6点，都是吃饭的时间：在这期间，客人什么时候来就什么时候吃。因此选项A是正确答案。
42.答案为B。此句为细节推理题。比较原文When you go to a home，the person who receives guests takes you to the living room first选项B的内容只是多了一个first，而这使不使用是一样的，因为客人一进来，主人就带你去living room，因此first不说也知道。
43.答案为C。此句为细节题。从选项的内容看，只有选项C与短文中的In Ghana you usually eat with your fingers.这句话的意思一样。
44.答案为D。此句为细节推理题。本题是根据Most Meals in Ghana have a dish called fufu.?it is very hard.这几句话的内容综合得出的，要用saw来锯开fufu 吃。可想而知是很hard的。
45.答案为D。此句为细节推理题。细读最后You must chew fufu well. or you may get sick.You eat fufu with the fingers of your right hand only.这几句话，就会发现选项A、B和C均在此句的意思中，因此选项D是正确答案。
