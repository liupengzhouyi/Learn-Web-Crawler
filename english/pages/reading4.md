　　Long bus rides are like television shows. They have a beginning,a middle,and an end with commercials thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. "Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.""Drink Good Wet Root Beer.""Fill up with Pacific Gas."Only if you sleep,which is equal to turning the television set off,are you spared the unending cry of "You Need It! Buy It Now!"
　　The beginning of the ride is comfortable and somewhat exciting,even if you‘ve traveled that way before. Usually some things have changednew houses,new buildings,sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it‘s fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless (鲁莽的) or daring,the ride can be as thrilling as a suspense story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right?or the left?hand lane? After a while,of course,the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you‘ve got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops.
　　The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know it will soon be over and there‘s a kind of expectation and excitement in that. The seat of course,has become harder as the hours have passed. By now you‘ve sat with your legs crossed,with your hands in your lap,with your hands on the armrestseven with your hands crossed behind your head. The end comes just at no more ways to sit.
