In one way of thinking, failure is a part of life. In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The ―spider story‖ is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider spinning a web(蜘蛛织网). The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times without success. On the seventh time he made it and went on to spin his web. Bruce is said to have taken heart and to have gone on to defeat the English? Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.
So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top from yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time?
Second, is the goal(目标)you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about his question, “If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?”This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway.
The third thing to bear in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to ―live with yourself even though you may have failed. Remember, ―You can't win them all.
