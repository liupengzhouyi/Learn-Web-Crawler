When Mrs.Joseph Groeger died recently in Vienna，Austria，people asked the obvious，"Why did she live to be 107?" Answers were provided by a survey conducted among 148 Viennese men and women who had reached the age of 100.Somewhat surprising was the fact that the majority had lived most of their lives in cities.In spite of the city's image as an unhealthy place，city living often provides benefits that country living can lack.One factor seems to be important to the longevity(长寿)of those interviewed. This factor is exercise.in the cities it is often faster to walk short distances than to wait for a bus.Even taking public transportation often requires some walking.Smaller apartment houses have no elevators(电梯)，and so people must climb stairs.City people can usually walk to local supermarkets Since parking spaces are hard to find，there is often no alternative to walking.
On the other hand，those who live in the country and suburbs do not have to walk every day.In fact，the opposite is often true.To go to school，work，or almost anywhere else，they must ride in cars.

在奥地利的维也纳，最近当一位名为Joseph Groeger的老妇人过世的时候，人们忍不住要问：“为什么她可以活到107岁呢?”当对148个100岁以上的维也纳人进行调查之后，我们得出了答案。有点让人惊讶的是，这些人中的多数人都大部分的人生都是在都市生活的。尽管城市给我们的印象一直都是不利于健康的，但是城市生活往往提供一些乡村缺乏的便利。其中有一个就是这些被调查者长寿的重要因素。这个因素就是锻炼。在城市，对于比较短的路程，往往走路比你等着坐公车去更快捷。就算去搭乘一些公共交通工具也经常要走一段路程。较小的公寓一般没有电梯，人们就不得不爬楼。城市人还经常步行去附近的超市买东西。在停车位如此难找的情况下，往往没有别的选择只有步行。
另一方面，那些住在乡村和郊区的人反而无需每天走路。事实上，他们每天都乘坐交通工具，去上学，去上班，或者去其他任何地方，都必须开车前往。
