We can make mistakes at any age.Some mistakes we make are about money.But most mistakes are about people."Did Jerry really care when I broke up with Helen?'When I got that great job，did Jerry really feel good about it，as a friend? Or did he envy my luck?" When we look back.doubts like these can make US feel bad.But when we look back.It's too late
Why do we go wrong about our friends-or our enemies? Sometimes what people say hides their real meaning.And if we don't really listen，we miss the feeling behind the words.Suppose someone tells you.''you're a lucky dog".Is he really on your side? if he says."You're a lucky guy"or"You’re a lucky gal".That's being friendly.But"lucky dog"?There's a bit of envy in those words Maybe he doesn't see it himself.But bringing in the''dog"bit puts you down a little.What he may be saying is that he doesn't think you deserve your luck.
How can you tell the real meaning behind someone's words? One way is to take a good look at the person talking.Do his words fit the way he looks? Does what he says square with the tone of voice? His posture(体态)?The look in his eyes? Stop and think.The minute you spend thinking about the real meaning of what people say to you may save another mistake
