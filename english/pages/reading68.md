Some of the notebooks George Washington kept as a young man are still in existence. They show that he was learning Latin，was very interested in the basics of good behavior in society，and was reading English literature.
At school he seems only to have been interested in mathematics.In fact，his formal education was surprisingly brief for a gentleman，and incomplete For unlike other young Virginian of that day，he did not go to the College of William and Mary in the Virginian capital of Williamsburg.In terms of formal training then，Washington contrasts sharply with some other early American Presidents such as John Adams，Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.In later years，Washington probably regretted his lack of intellectual training He never felt comfortable in a debate in Congress(国会)，or on any Subject that had not to do with everyday，practical matters And because he never learned French and could not speak directly to the French leaders，he did not visit the country he admired SO much.Thus，unlike Jefferson and Adams，he never reached Europe

George Washington 年轻时候的一些手札仍然保存完好。从这些手札中我们可以得知，当时的George Washington正在学习拉丁语言和阅读一些英国文学，并对基本的优雅社交行为深感兴趣。
在学校的学习中，George Washington好像只喜欢数学这一科。实际上，他作为一个标准绅士的正式教育是不完整的，简直简短的令人惊讶。和当时弗吉尼亚州的年轻人不同，他没有去位于弗吉尼亚州府威廉堡的William and Mary 学院。那么在正式的训练方面，Washington和其他早期的美国总统——如John Adams, Thomas Jefferson 和James Madison就有着鲜明的对比。在后来的日子里，Washington大概对自己教育的缺乏感到后悔了。无论是对于国会的商讨活动，还是其他并不是每天都常见的问题，或者一些实践性的事物，Washington始终不能轻松应对。而且因为他从没学过法语，无法和法国的领导人直接交流，所以没能去访问这个他最向往的国家。因此，和Jefferson还有Adams不同，他始终也没有访问过欧洲。
