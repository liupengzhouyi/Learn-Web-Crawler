　　Acting is such an over-crowded profession that the only advice that should be given to a young person thinking of going on the stage is“Don?t!”.But it is useless to try to discourage someone who feels that he must act，although the chances of his becoming famous are slim. The normal way to begin is to go to a drama sch001.Usually only students who show promise and talent are accepted，and the course lasts two years.Then the young actor or actress takes up work with a theatrical company(剧团)，usually as an assistant stage manager This means doing everything that there is to do in the theatre and occasionally acting in very small parts It is very hard work indeed，the hours are long and the salary is tiny.
　　Of course，some people have remarkable chances which lead to fame and Success without this long and hard training.Connie Pratt，for example，was just an ordinary girl working in a bicycle factory.A film producer happened to catch sight of her one morning waiting at a bus stop，as he drove past in his car.He stopped and got out to speak to the girl.He asked if she would like to go to the film studio to do a test，and she thought he was joking Then she got angry and said she would call the police It took the producer twenty minutes to convince Connie that he was serious The test was successful.And within a few weeks she was playing the leading part opposite one of the most famous actors of the day But chances like this happen once in a blue moon

参考翻译

　　演艺界是一个人口密度过高的职业。对于想登上舞台的年轻人的唯一建议就是不要进入。但是想劝阻那些明知成功的机会很渺茫却执意要做演员的人，这种说教是无用的。要做演员通常办法就是去戏剧学院进修。通常这里只接受有前途和有天赋的学生，课程要花2年的时间。之后，年轻的女艺人或者男艺人以舞台助理的身份，参与到剧团的工作。这意味着要做和舞台相关的所有事务和偶尔的跑龙套。这确实是很辛苦的工作，工作时间长，薪水又少的可怜。
　　当然，有些人没有经过长期辛苦训练，而是是通过不寻常的机会就获得了声望和成功。例如说，Connie Pratt原本是自行车厂的一个普通女工。某个早晨她在公车站等车的时候被一个开车路过的电影制作人看中了。制作人停车出来和她交谈，问她是否愿意来摄影棚试镜。Connie认为他只是在开玩笑罢了。最后她生气了，还威胁说要叫警察。最后制作人花了20分钟的时间让Connie相信他是认真的。试镜很成功。几个星期之后，她就作为女主角和当时很有名的一个男演员在一部戏中演对手戏了。但是，类似这样的机会少之又少啊。
