这里要讲述Andrew Jackson 和Martin Van Buren这2届美国总统的小故事。这2个小故事也许可以解释美语中OK一词的来历。故事的真实性我们不得而知，不过内容却很有意思。
第一个解释来源于总统Andrew Jackson的故事。Andrew Jackson几乎没有受到过什么教育，事实上，他对于日常的读写都有困难。当收到重要文件的时候，在尝试阅读之后，还是让他的助手帮忙解释文件的内容。如果批准一份文件，Andrew Jackson就在上面写“all correct”。麻烦的是，他不知道怎么这2个单词怎么拼写，因此，实际上他在文件上写的是“ol korekt”。过了不久，他又把这2个单词缩写为“OK”。
第二个解释来源于总统Martin Van Buren的家乡的名字——纽约的Kinderhook。为了帮助Van Buren成为总统，他的朋友为此组织了一个社团。他们把这个社团叫做Old Kinderhook Club，社团中支持Van Buren的人都被称为“OK”
