In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries (神秘的事物) of nature. Some ancient peoples believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons (武器) of the gods.
In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometres long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs (灯泡).
The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod (避雷针). This device (装置物) protects buildings from being damaged by lightning.
Modern science has discovered that one stroke (闪击) of lightning has a voltage (电压) of more than 15 million volts (伏特). A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second.
Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average (平均数) of one person every day.
The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car. Outside, one should go to low ground and not get under tress. Also, one should stay out of water and away from metal fences. Inside a house, people should avoid open doorways and windows and not touch wires or metal things.

最早的时候，男人认为闪电是一个伟大的奥秘(神秘的事物)自然。一些古人认为闪电和雷声是武器(武器)的神。在现实中，闪电是电流在高空形成。一个闪电，长1.6公里，有足够的电力一百万个灯泡(灯泡)。美国的科学家和政治家，本杰明富兰克林，是显示在1752电和闪电之间的联系的第一。在同一年，他还建造了第一个避雷针(避雷针)。这个装置(装置物)保护建筑物免遭雷击破坏。现代科学已经发现一个冲程(闪击)闪电(电压)具有电压超过15000000伏(伏特)。一个闪光的云层和地面之间的闪电可能长达13公里，并以每秒30000000米的速度旅行。科学家们认为，大约有2000000000的闪电每年。闪电击中帝国大厦在纽约市每年30到48次。仅在美国就导致平均(平均数)每天一人。是电风暴的情况下最安全的地方是在一个封闭的车。外面，一个应该去低接地和不到树下。同时，应远离水和金属栅栏。在家里，人们应该避免敞开的门口和窗户，不要触摸电线或金属的东西。闪电，它是更好的安全比遗憾?
