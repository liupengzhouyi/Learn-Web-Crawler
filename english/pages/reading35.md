　　Are you thinking of writing someone a letter? Call instead. It isn‘t that expensive, especially when you call during the evening, night, or weekend hours. In fact, you can make a ten-minute call anywhere in the continental United States for just $2.60.
　　For even greater saving, always dial direct, that is, without an operator‘s help. Rates(资;费) on direct calls are lower after five o‘clock in the evening and lowest after eleven o‘clock at night. Collect, person-to-person, and pay phone calls require the services of an operator, and they cost more than direct calls.
　　Need to call out of the country? Now calls to many overseas places may be dialed direct. Check your telephone direction for overseas area codes.
　　Next time you have good news, or you just want to stay in touch, remember, a phone call means so much more than a letter. This has been a message from Southern Bell Telephone Company.
