Children in the United States are exposed to many influences other than that of their families.Television is the most significant of these influences，because the habit of watching television usually begins before children start attending school.
Parents are concerned about the lack of quality in television programs for children.The degree of violence in many of these shows also worries them.Studies indicate that，when children are exposed to violence，they many become aggressive or insecure. Parents are also concerned at，out the commercials that their children see on television. Many parents would like to see fewer commercials during programs for children.And some parents feel that these shows should not have any commercials at all because young minds are not mature enough to deal with the claims made by advertisers.
Educational television has no commercials and has programs for children that many parents approve of The most famous of these is Sesame Street，which tries to give preschool children a head start in learning the alphabet(字母)and numbers.It also flies to teach children useful things about the world in which they live.
Even though most parents and educators give Sesame Street and shows like it high marks for quality，some critics argue that all television，whether educational or not，is harmful to children.These critics feel that the habit of watching hours of television every day turns children into bored and passive(被动的)consumers of their world rather than encouraging them to become active explorers of it.

现在的美国儿童与他们的父母不同，受到各个方面的影响。这些影响中最重要的是电视节目，因为常常在孩子们还没上学之间就养成了看电视的习惯了。
家长们对于儿童节目质量的低下很担忧。这些节目中出现的暴力的程度也烦恼着他们。研究显示，当儿童接触到暴力相关的节目，很多人会变得具有攻击性或者没有安全感。家长们对于孩子们在电视上看到的广告同样也很担忧。在儿童节目的时间，家长建议减少广告的播出。一些家长甚至认为这种时间段的节目中根本不应该有广告，鉴于儿童的思想还不够成熟，不能对广告中的一些话语做出判断。
教育台没有广告，而且播出的儿童节目家长们都很赞赏。其中有个最有名的节目叫芝麻街，主要是给学龄前儿童关于数字和字母的启蒙教育，以及对他们所在的世界的一些有帮助的认识。
即便大多数的家长和教育者给与芝麻街，以及这类的节目很高的评价，一些评论家还是认为所有的电视节目，无论教育性与否，对于儿童都是有害的。他们认为每天看几个小时电视这种习惯让儿童变成世界消极无聊且被动的取食者，而不是鼓励儿童变成世界积极的探索者
