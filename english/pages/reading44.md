Soldiers and other military people wear uniforms with various other symbols to indicate their status.But in the business world everyone wears more or less similar suits，and you cannot tell at a glance who ranks higher or lower than another.So how do people in the business world show their superiority? An attempt to study this was made by two researchers using a series of silent films.They had two actors play the parts of an executive(经理)and a visitor，and switch roles each time.The scene had one man at his desk playing the part of an executive，while the other，playing the part of a visitor，knocks at the door，opens it and approaches the desk to discuss some business matter.
The audience watching the films was asked to rate the executive and the visitor in terms of status.A certain set of rules about status began to emerge from the ratings.The visitor showed the least amount of status when he stopped just inside the door to talk across the room to the seated man.He was considered to have more status when he walked halfway up to the desk，and he had the most status when he walked directly up to the desk and stood right in front Of the seated executive.
Another thing that affected the status of the visitor in the eyes of the observers was the time between knocking and entering.For the seated executive，his status was also affected by the time between hearing the knock and answering.The quicker the visitor entered the room，the more status he had.The longer the executive took to answer，the more status he had.
