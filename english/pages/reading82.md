"American dream? What a lie!" This comment(评论) was made by a Cuban teenage girl. She was attending a huge protest(抗议) in Havana, Cuba, against American immigration laws last Tuesday.
Tens of thousands of people, including Cuba's President, Fidel Castro, took part in the protest to remember 30 missing Cubans, including 13 children. Their boat was lost in the Florida Straits after setting out from Cuba on November 17. It is one of the worst accidents involving(牵扯到) Cubans being smuggled(偷渡) into the US. Fourteen people died in the sinking of a smuggler's boat in 1998, and about 40 people died in 1994 when a tugboat sank near Havana. Castro believes that the "Cuban Adjustment Act" is responsible for the 30 people disappearing.
This 1996 law gives special allowances to Cuban immigrants who reach US land by whatever means. It gives them resident's status(居民身份) and chances to work. It is very different from the US policy to immigrants from other countries. Because it encourages illegal immigration and these types of accidents, some called it "the murderous law".
The US uses the so-called "dry foot, wet foot" rule. Those found at sea are sent back to Cuba. But those who set foot on US soil are generally allowed to stay. Castro said that the law encourages Cubans to undertake dangerous sea journeys with the hope of living in the US.
The immigration policy of the US has caused many problems between the US and Cuban. The two countries plan to meet next month to discuss immigration issues.
