Over two thousand years ago Rome(罗马)was the center of a huge empire. The Romans needed a way to move their large armies quickly so that they could protect their huge country. They needed land trade routes, so they joined all parts of their empire by a net-work of roads(公路网).
Beginning in 300 B.C., the Romans built roads in Europe, Asia and North Africa. By 200A.D., they had built 50, 000 miles of almost straight roads.
To build their roads, the Romans moved away all soft soil. They dug until they reached hard ground. Then they added layers(层)of stone and other things. The most important roads were paved(铺设)with large flat(平)stones. Main Roman roads were sometimes as wide as ours today.
To build their roads, the Romans sometimes had to dig tunnels through mountains. But they didn't have any machines to help them. So they heated the rock with fire and then threw cold water over it. When the rock cracked(裂), they dug it out. Roman soldiers and slaves built the roads with their hands and simple tools, but the roads were so well built that they were used for hundreds of years.
