One should be moderate(适度) in all things. Moderation is always the safest way to do things and a virtue(品质)we should have. Let's take the student life for example. There are some students who study too hard and play too little, while there are others who play too much and study too little. On one hand, it is harmful to his health if he has too few exercises, and on the other hand, it is harmful to his mind if he plays too much.
In the matter of eating, one also should be moderate. Do not eat too much or too little. Too much eating will make you sick, while too little eating will make you weak.
The man of progress is he who neither has too high an opinion of himself nor thinks too poorly of himself. If a man thinks too highly of himself, he is sure to become very proud, but if he has too poor an opinion of himself, he will have no courage to make an advance. Both the conditions above will make you lose your advancing aim. A broadminded man is he who always moves within the orbit (轨道)of reasonableness. Whether in any activities in life, moderation is one of the best ways to enjoy real happiness.
