　　A man was sitting in the park watching the ducks on the pond. When a woman approached him. She had a white poodle(鬃毛狮子狗) on a leash (系狗的链子).
　　She sat down on a bench, took out a magazine and began to read .
　　After it had been sitting quietly for about ten minutes, the poodle turned and looked up at the man.
　　―Excuse me,‖ the dog whispered. ―But you look like a kind man. Please buy me from his awful woman.‖The man could hardly believe his ears. A dog was whispering to him. In English!
　　―She is so mean to me,‖ the dog continued. ―She never pets me or plays with me when she‘s in a bad mood, which is most of the time.‖
　　The man was amazed to hear the dog say all this. He was even more surprised when the dog added, ―And I‘m really a very good dog. I‘m quite famous, too. I won a medal in the last war and was twice wounded in action. I‘ve rescued three children-two from drowning and one from a fire.‖
　　The man decided that he would try to buy the dog from the woman. He would pay a lot of money if necessary. The dog would soon earn tens of thousands of dollars on television. It would be the world‘s first talking dog.
　　―Excuse me,‖ he said to the woman, ―but I love your little dog. Will you sell him to me?‖ ―I‘ll be delighted to sell him,‖ the woman said. ―You can have him for ten dollars.‖
　　―Ten dollars!‖ the man said. ―Only the dollars? Why so little?‖ ―Because,‖ the woman said, ―he‘s a trouble-making liar.‖
