　In East Africa there is a bribe(部落) of people called the Masai. They are tall and slim(苗条的) and carry long spears to guard their cattle against an attacking lion or leopard(豹). These Africans move from place to place on the rolling(绵延起伏的) grasslands looking for suitable grazing(牧场) and water. Mboto is twelve years old. He helps his father drive the cattle. If the family decides to remain in one spot for a while, he helps gather sticks and thin branches to build a simple house. The sticks are placed in the ground in a circle. They are then bent inwards and joined at the top. Small branches and leaves fill the spaces. If it looks as if the family will stay longer than usual, then the inside walls are often plastered with cattle manure(粪). For a door there is only a small opening to allow a person to enter. A thorn(刺) fence is built around the small house to keep cattle safe at night. Lions, leopards and hyenas prowl(觅食) around after dark. So the cattle would be easily killed and eaten.
　　When Mboto grows up into a man, he will become a true Masai warrior(勇士). He will have to join other warriors in the strange custom of drinking blood. The blood is taken from the neck of one of their cattle. It is mixed with milk and together with meat. It becomes the main food for the men.
　　The Masai have lived this way for thousands of years. The only change that seems to have affected their lives is the use of the transistor(晶体管) radio. It is quite common to see a young warrior with a pair of earphones listening to music while has is with his cattle.
