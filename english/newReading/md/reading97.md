One silly question I simply can't stand is "How do you feel".Usually the question is asked of a man in action—a man on the go walking along the street or busily working at his desk. So what do you expect him to say? He'll probably say "Fine.I'm all right." But you've put a bug in his ear maybe now he's not sure. If you are a good friend,you may have seen something in his face,or his walk that he did not realize that morning. It starts him worrying a little. First thing you know he looks in a mirror to see if everything is all fight,while you go merrily on your way asking someone else. "How do you feel?" Every question has its time and place It's perfectly acceptable,for instance,to ask "How do you feel if you're visiting a close friend in the hospital. But if the fellow is walking on both legs, hurrying to make a train,or sitting at his desk working,it's no time to ask him that silly question. When George Bernard Shaw,the famous writer of plays was in his eighties,someone asked him "How doyou feel". Shaw put him in his place. "When you reach my age", he said. "either you feel all right or you're dead"

原文翻译
“你感觉怎么样”是一个愚蠢的让我无法忍受的问题。这个问题通常会问那些正在忙着的人——一个正沿着街道赶路去某地的人，或者一个正埋头工作的人。那么你期望从他那里得到什么答案呢?他很可能说“很不错”。但是你却给了他一个暗示——可能他当时不知道。如果你是他的一个好朋友，你也许在他脸上，或者走路的样子上发现什么他早晨没有觉察到的不妥。你的话使他开始感觉有点不安。你也猜的到，接着他要做的第一件事，就是找个镜子，看看自己是不是有什么不对。这个时候你却开心的我行我素，去问其他人这个问题了“你感觉怎么样?”
每个问题都有它提问的适当时机和场合。例如，如果你去医院探望一个亲密的朋友，这个时候你问他“你觉得怎么样?”就十分的恰当。但是，如果这个人匆忙赶路去赶火车，或者在埋头工作，没有时间去他这种傻瓜问题。
当George Bernard Shaw——一个著名的剧作家，在他80多岁的时候，有人问他：“你感觉怎么样”，Shaw让这个人站在自己的角度来想想。“当你到了我这个年龄，”他说“要么你感觉良好，要么你已经死了。”
