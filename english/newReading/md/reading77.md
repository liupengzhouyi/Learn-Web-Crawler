Excused from recycling because you live in a high rise with a rubbish chute? You won't be for long. Miami's Mark Shantzis has made it simple for those living in tall buildings to use the chute and recycle too.
In Shantzis' Hi-Rise Recycling System, a chute leads to a pie-shaped container with six boxes that can turn around when operated. The system, which fits in the same space as the chute and container now in use, enables glass, plastic, paper, metal, and other rubbish to go into separate boxes.
The system is controlled from a board fixed next to the chute door. The board has a button for each class of recycling materials (as well as for unrecyclables). At the press of a button, a microcomputer locks all other floors' chute door and sets the recycling container turning until the right box comes under the chute. The computer also counts the loads and gives a signal by phone when the box is full. And a particular piece of equipment breaks up the nonrecyclables.
Sorting(分类) recyclables before they are collected saves the use of expensive materials recovery equipment which otherwise has to do the sorting. Such equipment often makes recycled materials very expensive, so expensive that tons of recyclables remain wasted. Shantzis believes his system could help recycled materials become more cost-effective.

### 1. B。考查写作目的。文章第1段说：由于你住在带有垃圾通道的高层建筑里，对垃圾的回收不便是情有可原的;但是在不久的将来这种不回收的借口是不存在的了。美国迈阿密州 Mark Shantzis 已经使住在高层建筑里的人们利用垃圾通道回收利用垃圾变得简单了，应选 B。
### 2. D。Mark Shantzis 已经使得住在高层建筑里的人们利用垃圾通道回收利用垃圾变成了一件简单的事，应选D。
### 3. C。文章第2段言及这套垃圾处理系统含有六个可旋转的容器;文章第3段言及只要你按一种按钮，这个电脑系统就将其余各层其余的通道锁住，只让你按的那个按钮的通道畅通。因此按何种按钮是垃圾分类的关键。
### 4. C。文章最后一段提及，在收集垃圾之前将它们分类节省了使用分类设备的费用，而使用这些设备又得被回收物质白白地浪费了。Shantzis 相信这套回收系统有助于可回收物质变得更有(经济)效益。
