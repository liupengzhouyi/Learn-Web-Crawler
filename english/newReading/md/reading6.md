　　Soldiers and other military people wear uniforms with various other symbols to indicate their status.But in the business world everyone wears more or less similar suits，and you cannot tell at a glance who ranks higher or lower than another.So how do people in the business world show their superiority? An attempt to study this was made by two researchers using a series of silent films.They had two actors play the parts of an executive(经理)and a visitor，and switch roles each time.The scene had one man at his desk playing the part of an executive，while the other，playing the part of a visitor，knocks at the door，opens it and approaches the desk to discuss some business matter.
　　The audience watching the films was asked to rate the executive and the visitor in terms of status.A certain set of rules about status began to emerge from the ratings.The visitor showed the least amount of status when he stopped just inside the door to talk across the room to the seated man.He was considered to have more status when he walked halfway up to the desk，and he had the most status when he walked directly up to the desk and stood right in front Of the seated executive.
　　Another thing that affected the status of the visitor in the eyes of the observers was the time between knocking and entering.For the seated executive，his status was also affected by the time between hearing the knock and answering.The quicker the visitor entered the room，the more status he had.The longer the executive took to answer，the more status he had.

参考翻译

　　士兵和其他军队中的人都要穿制服，并且衣服上有各种各样的标志来表明他们的身份地位。但是在商业的世界中，几乎每个人都穿的差不多一样的衣服。乍看之下，很难分出身份地位的高低。那么,在商界,人们如果表明自己高人一等呢?
　　2个研究者通过一系列的默剧对此进行尝试和研究。剧中只有2个演员，分饰经理和拜访者的角色，每次两人都要交换角色。剧中演的是经理坐在办公桌旁边办公，来访者敲门，推开门，往办公桌走去，和经理讨论业务上的事情。
　　观看的观众被要求说出经理和拜访者的地位孰高孰低。从观众的意见总结出一套地位的归路。当拜访者站在刚进门的地方，远远的穿过整个房间和经理说话，表明来访者的地位最低。当拜访者站在门和桌子的中间时，地位较高;当他径直走到桌子旁边站在经理前面时，地位最高。
　　在观众眼中，另一个影响拜访者地位的事情是他敲门和进房间之间的时间间隔。对于坐在那里的经理来说，他的地位受听到敲门和应答的时间间隔的影响。拜访者越早的进入房间，他的地位就越高。
　　经理越迟应答敲门声，他的地位越高。
