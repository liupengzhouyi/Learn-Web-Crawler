In 1933 an unknown American called Clarence Nash went to see the filmmaker Walt Disney. He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon(动画片) film for children. When Walt Disney heard Nash's voice, he said "Stop! That's our duck!"
The duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the film The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat(水上住家) and wore his sailor jacket and hat. Later that year he became a star after an eight-minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audience liked him because he was lazy and greedy(贪婪的), and because he lost his temper(发脾气) very quickly . And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews(侄子). Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody like Mickey.
In the 1930S,' 40s and '50s Donald and hid friends Mickey , Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational films about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared---there were no more new cartoons.
Clarence Nash died in February, 1985. But today's children can still see the old cartoons on television and hear that famous voice.
