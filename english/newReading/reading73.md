Computer people talk a lot about the need for other people to become "computer-literate." But not all experts(专家) agree that this is a good idea.
One pioneer, in particular, who disagrees is David Tebbutt, the founder of Computertown UK. Although many people see this as a successful attempt to bring people closer to the computer, David does not see it that way. He says that Computer town UK was formed for just the opposite reason, to bring computers to people and make them people-literate?
David Tebbutt thinks Computertowns are most successful when tied to a computer club but he insists there is an important difference between the two. The clubs are for people who have some computer knowledge already. This frightens away non-experts, who are happier going to Computertowns where there are computers for them to experiment on, with experts to encourage them and answer any questions they have. They are not told what to do. They find out. The computer experts have to learn not to tell people about computers, but have to be able to answer all questions people ask. People don't have to learn computer terms(术语), but the experts have to explain in plain language. The computers are becoming people-literate?

### 1. A。文中第1段和第2段开头已经告诉读者，David Tebbutt 不同意普通人要学会电脑本身的有关知识。后文中还提及他的观点是 ...bring computer to people and make them people-literate 以及让 experts have to explain in plain language 等，可知 A 为正确答案。
### 2. D。文章最后一段是解释 people-literate 的含义。
### 3. B。文章第2段说 David Tebbutt 不主张人向电脑靠拢，而主张电脑向人靠拢，这种人文观念正好说明正确答案为 B。
### 4. D。文章第3段主要叙述：进电脑俱乐部的人一般都有一些电脑知识，这会把那些想在电脑上试试身手，且有专家鼓励他们提问的非专业人士吓跑;而在电脑城里，电脑专家只需回答人们的提问，不必讲授一些电脑术语，而只用浅显的语言讲解电脑的使用知识，由此可见，电脑城是为普及电脑知识而开设的。
