　　The sea is the common possession of all nations. It belongs equally to all. No one can take it entirely to themselves; nor is it‘foreign’to any one.
　　This was the decision of John Marshall, chief Justice of the United States from 1801 to 1835. It was made known as a basic rule of the sea that no one, and therefore everyone, owns the ocean. This means that outside territorial waters (the waters within three miles of a country‘s coast),the law is whatever nations agree on in peacetime and whatever the strongest navy powers can enforce in wartime.
　　After the United States bought Alaska, Americans began to seize Canadians who were hunting seals outside Alaskan territorial waters. The Americans said that the seals were American possession because they often came into the Alaskan shores owned by the United States. International judges disagreed with this reasoning. In some cases, however, the special rights of a nation that makes good use of an open-sea area are recognized.
　　All of the sea‘s rules are set up by international conferences and agreements.
