Man is a land animal, but he is also closely tied to the sea. Throughout history the sea has served the needs of man. The sea has provided man with food and a convenient (便利的) way to travel to many parts of the world. Today, nearly two—thirds of the world's population live within 80 kilometers of the sea coast.
In the modern technological world, the sea offers many resources to help mankind survive (=continue to live). Resources on land are beginning to be used up. The sea, however, still can be hoped to supply many of man's needs.
The list of riches of the sea yet to be developed by man's technology is impressive. Oil and gas explorations (探险) have been carried out for nearly 30 years. Valuable amounts of minerals exist on the ocean floor ready to be mined (开采).
Fish farming promises to be a good way to produce large quantities of food. The culture of fish and shellfish (贝类动物) is an ancient skill practised in the past mainly by Oriental people.
Besides oil and gas, the sea may offer new sources of energy. Experts believe that the warm temperature of the ocean can be used in a way similar to the steam in a steamship. Ocean currents (水流) and waves offer possible use as a source of energy.
Technology is enabling man to explore (勘探) ever more deeply under the sea. The development of strong, new materials has made this possible.
The technology to harvest the sea continues to improve. Experts believe that by the year 2000 the problems that prevent us from exploiting fully the food, minerals, and energy sources of the sea will be largely solved.
