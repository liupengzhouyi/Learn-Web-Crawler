　　Not very long ago, a special family system(体系) existed in certain parts of South India. In this system, the actual head of a family unit was the mother‘s eldest brother, though the mother also had an important position in the family. In families of this kind, a husband was actually no more than a visitor. He did not live with his wife, but with his own mother, brothers and sisters in another house. He saw his sons and daughters sometimes, but the man who actually fed and cared for them and acted as their father was their uncle-their mother‘s brother.
　　But this system, in which brother and sisters take the place of the father, no longer exists in South India except in a few villages. Economic changes have had far reaching effect on family life. Family life began to change when men went out to work in factories and offices instead of working with their mothers, brothers, and sisters on the land. When a man went out to work he had money of his own and could buy his own land and build his own family, instead of depending on his mother and his brothers. He wanted to be independent. This is an example of the way in which economic relations can have an effect on family relation-ships.
