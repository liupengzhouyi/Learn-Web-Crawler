　　The director was angry. ―Why not?‖ he asked.
　　―Well, sir,‖ one of the men answered,‖ we are on the east coast here, and the sun sets in the west. We can get a sunrise over the sea, if necessary, but not a sunset.‖
　　―But I want a sunset!‖ the director shouted.‖ Go to the airport, take the next flight to the west coast, and get one.‖
　　But then a young secretary had an idea,‖ Why don‘t you photograph a sunrise,‖ she suggested, ―and then play it backwards? Then it would look like a sunset.‖
　　―That‘s a good idea!‖ the director said. Then he turned to the camera crew and said,‖ Tomorrow morning I want you to get me a beautiful sunrise over the sea.‖
　　The camera crew went out early the next morning and filmed a bright sunrise over the beach in the middle of the beautiful bay(海湾).Then at nine o‘clock they took it to the director. ―Here it is, sir.‖ They said and gave it to him .He was very pleased.
　　They all went to the studio(摄影棚). ―All right,‖ the director explained, ―now our hero and heroine are going to say goodbye. Run the film backwards so that we can see the ?sunset‘ behind them.‖
